# JitterTravel — Claude Code Notes

## Architecture Rules

### Event Storage: use CommandExecutor, never EventStore directly

Application services must **never** receive `EventStore` as a constructor dependency.
All event appending from application services must go through `CommandExecutor`:

- `commandExecutor.execute(...)` — for domain commands with a decision context
- `commandExecutor.appendEvents(...)` — for internal actions (clearing conflicts, migrations, etc.)

**Why:** `EventStore.append()` requires the command to already exist in `command_log` (foreign
key constraint). `CommandExecutor` enforces this ordering. Bypassing it causes FK violations
and partial writes (some events land, others don't).

**TODO:** Add an ArchUnit test that verifies no class in the `application` package has a
field of type `EventStore`. See `src/test/java/.../architecture/` for the right home.
